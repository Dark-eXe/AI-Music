This repository contains the AI Music senior design project developed during the Fall 2022 semester at UNLV (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) for submission to the Fred and Harriet Cox Senior Design Competition.<br>
This project won the competition under the Department of Computer Science.<br><br>

The trained music-generating AI's primary design characteristic is of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. See */Project/ai/TRAINING.ipynb* Cell 21 to see the full NN (Neural Network) architecture.<br>

execute Project/UI.py

The project was originally developed using BitBucket for version control during the Fall 2022 semester at UNLV. At September 5th 2024, Andrew Turangan reinitiated the repository into GitHub.<br><br>
***UPDATE 9/5/24:<br>
After initial testing, all .h5 models created in 2022 are outdated. Trained PianoAnime.keras model with success - currently the only working model. Will train other models under .keras in future.
